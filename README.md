# count-primes

These benchmarks compare performance characteristics of different programming languages.
In each language I implemented exactly the same algorithm that counts the number of primes between 0 and 20000000.

The results are:
003.9s C#
004.0s C
004.3s C++
004.3s Fortran
004.6s Java
004.7s Scala
005.7s JavaScript
013.3s Julia
013.4s Go
014.3s FreePascal
014.8s Swift
019.0s Rust
020.1s Haskell
052.4s PHP
064.0s Ruby
128.0s Python
148.0s Lua
177.0s Perl
214.0s Tcl
402.0s R
